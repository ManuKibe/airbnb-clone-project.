**🚀 Feature Breakdown**
🔐 User Management
This feature handles user registration, authentication, and profile management. The system provides safe authorization procedures while enabling users with different roles to use the platform securely.

🏡 Property Management
Through this capability hosts can maintain their property listings by updating and listing their properties for management purposes. Within this feature users find all essential tools which help properties become noticeable across the platform.

📅 Booking System
Users can use the search function to reserve existing properties during selected dates. Enterprise supports booking record management as well as check-in and check-out procedures and prevents multiple bookings of the same space.

💳 Payment Processing
Transactions associated with property bookings go through the financial handling system. The system processes payments through connected gateways while storing transaction data in secure fashion. The system also determines costs and completes payment transactions.

🌟 Review System
The system enables property visitors to submit reviews together with ratings about their accommodations. Hosts can build stronger trust relationships with their users because of this platform's review system.

📚 API Documentation
The backend APIs implement documentation through OpenAPI standard which enables both REST and GraphQL formats. The system enhances connectivity between frontend client applications and external third-party programs.

⚙️ Data Optimization
The system implements caching together with database indexing techniques to boost its operational speed. The optimization methods decrease program loading periods and maintain constant growth capacity throughout expanding application needs.

  **🔒 API Security**
🔑 Authentication
The security token JWT (JSON Web Tokens) allows secure user authentication on all network endpoints. Users are restricted from performing sensitive operations including bookings and payments through a system that verifies their identity before they can access.

🛂 Authorization
RBAC access control mechanisms will differentiate guest users from host users thus granting them access to specific resources determined by their authorized permissions. The protection system blocks unauthorized changes to user data along with host listings.

🚫 Rate Limiting
Rate limitations established within the system serve to stop brute-force attacks and API spamming attempts from occurring. The system stays stable through this method while avoiding denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

🧾 Secure Payments
Users will conduct payments through endpoints secured by HTTPS and third-party payment processing with Stripe technology. All sensitive financial information receives encryption protection which means it exists as encrypted text instead of readable text.

🔐 Data Protection
All user passwords will receive hash encryption while all sensitive fields become encrypted for storage. The security measures protect individual information together with transaction-related data from unauthorized access and breaches.
